# Poller
Poller is a graphical polling website.
It allows users to create polls, edit, and delete them.
Other users including the poll creator can vote on the newly created poll at most once.
The poll results can be viewed graphically by the poll creator. 
Users are also able to search for other users and view the polls they created.
